# **What is the best machine learning model to predict the house prices?**

## **Project motivation**
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms to predict the house prices based on a dataset provided by Kaggle.

First of all, it is important to keep in mind that this is not a generalist analysis and that we are obviously going to measure the performance of these models on a given data set. This performance would surely change on a different dataset, although it can help us to discover how accurately house prices can be predicted with the variables present in this dataset.

The dataset can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

## **Installations**

Several quick start options are available:
- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Otherwise you can directly use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

## **Files description**

- **HousePrices_Capstone**: Jupyter Notebook with the code used to carry out the analysis.
- **train.csv** : Data set used for the analysis.


## **Interaction with the project**
The best way to interact with this analysis is to download the [CSV files](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) described above and the .ypnb file and open them in any program that allows it. In this way you will be able to check the veracity and accuracy of the results obtained.
